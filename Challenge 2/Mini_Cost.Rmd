Objective 1: Minimize Weight Carrying Cost. 
We have a set of orders with their codes.
```{r}
codes <-c('SRY020','SSR001'
,'SRY020',
'SSY020',
'SSR001',
'SSR001',
'SRY020',
'SSR001',
'SSY020',
'SRY020')
```

This is a list of the distance for each cell. The start is at the left top. The counting sequence is top to buttom, left to right. 
```{r}
distance<- c(0.60526, 0.62406, 0.60526, 0.62406, 0.6015,
                            0.6015, 0.66165, 0.71804, 0.81203, 0.98872,
                            0.29699, 0.31578, 0.29699, 0.31954, 0.33834,
                            0.42857, 0.50375, 0.65413, 0.81954, 0.99248,
                            0.03383, 0.03383, 0.07518, 0.14661, 0.2218,
                            0.34586, 0.50751, 0.65413, 0.78195, 0.99248,
                            0.01503, 0.01127, 0.06015, 0.13157, 0.21052,
                            0.33834, 0.50375, 0.64285, 0.81578, 0.97368,
                            0.00375, 0, 0.00375, 0.13157, 0.21804, 0.3609,
                            0.49248, 0.65789, 0.79323, 1)

Weight Carry Cost = distance * distance unit cost * Weight of product
Weight of Product = unit *unit weight
The weight function below is to return the weight of each product based on their codes. 
```{r}
weight<- function(code) {
  code <- strsplit(code, "")[[1]]
  if (code[2] =='R'){
    weight_per_unit <- 5
  }
  else{
    weight_per_unit <- 15
  }
  if(code[3] == 'B'){
    return (as.numeric(code[4])*weight_per_unit)
  }
  else if (code[3]=='Y'){
    return (as.numeric(code[5])*weight_per_unit)
  }
  else{
    return (as.numeric(code[6])*weight_per_unit)
  }
} 
```


Total_cost function, which is to times the distance unit cost and distance and weight, to get the total cost. 
```{r}
total_cost <- function(i,j ) {
  total_cost <- (2/0.00001)*distance[j]*weight(codes[i])
  return(total_cost)
}
```

OMPR is used for this optimization model
The optimization objective function looks like:
```{r}
setwd("/Users/leo/Desktop/capstone")
'![objective.](Users/leo/Desktop/capstone/ob_func.png)'
```
The objective funciton is the sum of each products' cost, and we try to minimize it. 
total_cost[i,j] is the weight carrying cost according to the product index i and cell index j. 
x[i,j] is a binary variable, and we have constraints to make sure only one product to be placed in one cell, 
and one cell only contains one product. 
```{r}
library(ompr)
library(magrittr)
model <- MIPModel() %>%
  add_variable(x[i, j], i=1:10, j=1:50, type="binary") %>%
  set_objective(sum_over(total_cost(i, j)*x[i, j], i = 1:10, j = 1:50), sense = "min") %>%
  add_constraint(sum_over(x[i, j], i=1:10)<=1, j=1:50) %>%
  add_constraint(sum_over(x[i, j], j=1:50)==1, i=1:10) 
model
```

Solve the model
```{r}
library(ompr.roi)
library(ROI.plugin.glpk)
result <- solve_model(model, with_ROI(solver = "glpk", verbose = TRUE))
matching <- result %>% 
  get_solution(x[i,j])
matching

```


Compare the cost with the naive method: By allocating the products to the nearest spot available. 
```{r}
df <- data.frame(matrix(0, nrow = 5, ncol = 10, dimnames = list(paste("row", 1:5), 1:10)))

products = matching$i[matching$value == 1]
rows = matching$j[matching$value == 1]%/%length(df) + 1
cols = matching$j[matching$value == 1]%%length(df)

# calculating product weights
myweights = c()
for (indices in 1:length(codes)) {
  myweights = c(myweights, weight(codes[indices]))
}

# updating the matrix
for (indices in 1:length(rows)) {
  df[rows[indices], cols[indices]] <- paste(products[indices], myweights[products][indices])
}

# naive method
closest= sort(distance)[1:length(products)]
naive = 0
for (indices in 1:length(products)) {
  naive = naive + (2/0.00001)*closest[indices]*weight(codes[indices])
}


## Saving
(naive - result$objective_value)/ naive * 100
